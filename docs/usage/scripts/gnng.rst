About
=====

**gnng** Fetches interface information from routing and firewall devices. This
includes network and IP information along with the inbound and outbound filters
that  may be applied to the interface. Skips un-numbered and disabled
interfaces by default. Works on Cisco, Foundry, Juniper, and NetScreen devices.

Usage
=====

Here is the usage output::

    % gnng -h

Examples

Displaying interfaces for a device
----------------------------------

To fetch interface information for a device, just provide its hostname as an argument::

    % gnng test1-abc.net.aol.com
    DEVICE: test1-abc.net.aol.com
    Interface  | Addresses     | Subnets        | ACLs IN | ACLs OUT    | Description                                       
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    fe-1/2/1.0 | 10.10.20.38   | 10.10.20.36/30 |         | count_all   | this is an interface 
               |               |                |         | test_filter |                                                   
    ge-1/1/0.0 | 1.2.148.246   | 1.2.148.244/30 |         | filterbad   | and so is this
    lo0.0      | 10.10.20.253  | 10.10.20.253   | protect |             |                                                   
               | 10.10.20.193  | 10.10.20.193   |         |             |                                                   

You may specify any number of device hostnames as arguments, or to fetch ALL
devices pass the ``-a`` flag.

The rest is fairly self-explanatory.
