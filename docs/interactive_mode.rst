.. important::

    Throughout this documentation you will see commands or code preceded by
    a triple greater-than prompt (``>>>``). This indicates that they are being
    entered into a Python interpreter in *interactive mode*.

    To start Python in *interactive mode*, it's as simple as executing
    ``python`` from a command prompt::

        % python
        Python 2.7.2 (default, Jun 20 2012, 16:23:33)
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
        >>>

    For more information, please see the `official Python documentation on
    interactive mode
    <http://docs.python.org/tutorial/interpreter.html#interactive-mode>`_.
