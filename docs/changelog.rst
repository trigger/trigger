Changelog
=========

.. _v1.4:

1.4
===

+ Task queue now supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite. See the
  :ref:`db-settings` for more information!

  - There's a new :setting:`DATABASE_ENGINE` that allows you to specify.
  - New tool to initialize your database w/ ease: ``init_task_db``

.. _v1.3.1:

1.3.1
=====

+ General changes

  - New contrib package for optional extensions to core Trigger
    features, `~trigger.contrib.commando.CommandoApplication` being
    the first.
  - Remove legacy mtsync check from bin/fe.
  - Conditionally import MySQLdb so we can still do testing without
    it.

+ The following changes have been madw within `~trigger.acl.parser`,
  which provides Trigger's support for parsing network access control
  lists (ACLs) and firewall policies:

  - :bug:`72` Bugfix in `~trigger.acl.parser.TIP` where an invalid
    network preifx (e.g. '1.2.3.1/31' would throw an
    ``AttributeError`` when checking the ``negated`` attribute and
    shadowing the original ``ValueError``.

+ The following changes have been made within `~trigger.cmds`, which
  provides an extensible, developer-friendly interface to writing
  command exeuction adapters:

  - Added ``with_errors`` argument to `~trigger.cmds.Commando`
    constructor to toggle whether errors are raised as exceptions or
    returned as strings.
  - Allow timeout to be set as a class variable in
    `~trigger.cmds.Commando` subclasses, preferrring timeout passed to
    constructor in `~trigger.cmds.Commando` subclasses.

+  The following changes have been made within `~trigger.netdevices`:

  - Refactor how we id Brocade switches for startup/commit (fix #75)

    * It's assumed that all Brocade devices all act the same;
    * Except in the case of the VDX, which is treated specially.

  - Simplified how ``startup_commands`` are calculated
  - Disable SQLite loader if sqlite3 isn't available for some reason.
  - Prompt patterns are now bound to `~trigger.netdevices.Vendor`
    objects object when `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevices` is populated.
  - `~trigger.netdevices.Vendor` objects now have a ``prompt_pattern``
    attribute.
  - All prompt patterns are now defined in ``settings.py``:

    * Vendor-specific: :setting:`PROMPT_PATTERNS`
    * IOS-like: :setting:`IOSLIKE_PROMPT_PAT`
    * Fallback: :setting:`DEFAULT_PROMPT_PAT`

+ The following changes have been made within `~trigger.twister`,
  which provides Trigger's remote execution functionality:

  - Added CLI support for Palo Alto Networks firewalls!
  - SSH Async now enabled by default for Arista, Brocade.
  - :feature:`54` Moved static definition of commands permitted to be
    executed when specified in a users' ``~/.gorc`` file into a new
    configuration setting :setting:`GORC_ALLOWED_COMMANDS`. The file
    location may now also be customized using :setting:`GORC_FILE`.
  - :bug:`68` Fix host lookup bug in `~trigger.twister.TriggerTelnet`
    causing telnet channels to crash.
  - :bug:`74` Fix error-detection for NetScaler devices.
  - Enhanced logging within `~trigger.twister` to include the device
    name where applicable and useful (such as in SSH channel
    debugging).
  - All ``execute_`` functions have been simplified to eliminate
    hard-coding of vendor checking wherever possible.
  - Beginnings of reworking of Generic vs. AsyncPTY SSH channels:

    * Most vendors support async/pty with little problems.
    * This will become the new default.
    * New execute helper: `~trigger.twister.execute_async_pty_ssh`
    * New error helper: `~trigger.twister.has_juniper_error`
    * Arista now uses `~trigger.twister.execute_async_pty_ssh`
    * A ``NetScalerCommandFailure`` will now just be a
      `~trigger.exceptions.CommandFailure`

+ Documentation

  - Updated README to callout CSV support.
  - Updated README to reflect branching model.
  - Updated supported vendors, and no longer promising NETCONF
    support.

.. _v1.3.0:

1.3.0
=====

.. warning::
   If you are upgrading from Trigger Before Upgrading from Trigger 1.2 or
   earlier, please heed these steps!

   + Add ``NETDEVICES_SOURCE = NETDEVICES_FILE`` to your ``settings.py``. This
     variable has replaced :setting:`NETDEVICES_FILE`.
   + Create your Bounce window mappings in ``bounce.py`` and put it in
     ``/etc/trigger/bounce.py``. See ``conf/bounce.py`` in the source
     distribution for an example.

+ General changes

  - All references to psyco have been removed as it doesn't support 64-bit and
    was causing problems in Python 2.7.3.
  - A new document, :doc:`new_vendors`, has been added to use as checklist for
    adding new vendor support to Trigger.
  - Added `Allan Feid <https://github.com/crazed>`_ as contributor for his
    *crazed* ideas.

+ :feature:`10` The following changes have been made within
  `~trigger.changemgmt`, which provides Trigger's support for bounce windows
  and timezones, to move the bounce window settings into configurable data vs.
  static in the module code.

  - This module has been convertd into a package.
  - The Bounce window API has been totally overhauled. Bounce windows are no
    longer hard-coded in `~trigger.changemgmt` and are now configured using
    ``bounce.py`` and specified using :setting:`BOUNCE_FILE`. The interface for
    creating `~trigger.changemgmt.BounceWindow` objects was greatly simplified
    to improve readability and usage.
   - Added sample ``bounce.py`` to ``conf/bounce.py`` in the Trigger source
     distribution.
   - New setting variables in ``settings.py``:

     - :setting:`BOUNCE_FILE` - The location of the bounce window mapping
       definitions. Defaults to ``/etc/trigger/bounce.py``.
     - :setting:`BOUNCE_DEFAULT_TZ` - Default timezone for bounce windows.
       Defaults to ``'US/Eastern'``.
     - :setting:`BOUNCE_DEFAULT_COLOR` - The default bounce risk-level status
       color. Defaults to ``'red'``.

+ :feature:`55` The following changes have been made within
  `~trigger.netdevices` to make it easier to populate
  `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevices` from arbitrary sources by implementing
  pluggable loaders.
  
  - This module has been converted into a package.
  - All hard-coded metadata parsing functions and associated imports have been
    replaced with loader plugin classes. Filesystem loaders provided by default
    for JSON, XML, Sqlite, Rancid, and *new*: CSV!). The bare minimum config for
    CSV is a newline-separated CSV file populated with "hostname,vendor"
  - New configuration setting: :setting:`NETDEVICES_LOADERS` used to define a
    list of custom loader classes to try in turn. The first one to return data
    wins.
  - The configuration settings :setting:`SUPPORTED_FORMATS` and
    :setting:`NETDEVICES_FORMAT` have been deprecated.
  - The configuration setting :setting:`NETDEVICES_SOURCE` has replaced
    :setting:`NETDEVICES_FILE`.
  - The sample ``settings.py`` (found at ``conf/trigger_settings.py`` in the
    source distribution) illustrates how one may use
    :setting:`NETDEVICES_SOURCE` and :setting:`NETDEVICES_LOADERS` to replace
    the deprecated settings :setting:`NETDEVICES_FORMAT` and
    :setting:`NETDEVICES_FILE`.

+ The following changes have been made within `~trigger.twister`, which
  provides Trigger's remote execution functionality:

  - :feature:`22` Added Aruba wireless controller and Brocade ADX/VDX support
    for execute/pty in trigger.twister and any device that requires pty-req and
    shell without actualling using a pty. The channel class for this
    functionality is called `~trigger.twister.TriggerSSHAsyncPtyChannel`
  - Added a new ``requires_async_pty`` attribute to
    `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevice` objects to help identify devices that
    require such channels.
  - Added a ``force_cli`` flag to `~trigger.twister.execute()` to force CLI
    execution on Juniper devices instead of Junoscript.
  - The default client factory (`~trigger.twister.TriggerClientFactory`) now
    calls `~trigger.tacacsrc.validate_credentials()` instead of directly
    instantiating `~trigger.tacacsrc.Tacacsrc` anytime credentials are
    populated automatically, resulting in only a single call to
    `~trigger.tacacsrc.Tacacsrc()`, when creds aren't provided.
  - Added error-detection for Brocade MLX devices.

+ The following changes have been made within `~trigger.cmds`, which provides
  an extensible, developer-friendly interface to writing command exeuction
  adapters: 

  - Added a ``force_cli`` flag to `~trigger.cmds.Commando` constructor to force
    CLI execution on Juniper devices instead of Junoscript.
  - The ``timeout`` value may now be set as a class variable in
    `~trigger.cmds.Commando` subclasses.
  - `~trigger.cmds.Commando` now steps through ``commands`` as iterables instead
    of assuming they are lists. The iterable is also now explicitly cast to a
    list when we need it be one.
  - A minor bugfix in `~trigger.cmds.Commando` causing results from multiple
    Commando instances to collide with each other because they were inheriting
    an empty results ``{}`` from the class object.
  - `~trigger.cmds.Commando` now accepts ``creds`` as an optional argument. If
    not set, it will default to reading user credentials from ``.tacacsrc``.

+ The following changes have been madw within `~trigger.acl.parser`, which
  provides Trigger's support for parsing network access control lists (ACLs)
  and firewall policies.

  - :feature:`12` Support has been added for parsing IPv6 addresses in Juniper
    firewall filters. (This does not include full IPv6 firewall support!)
  - :bug:`26` The ACL parers was modified to support negation of addresses
    using the syntax ``{ip} except;`` in Juniper firewall filters. To
    facilitate this a custom IP address class was created:
    `~trigger.acl.parser.TIP` (which is a subclass of ``IPy.IP``).
  - The prefix on /32 and /128 IPs in Juniper ACLs is now always displayed.

+ The following changes have been made within `~trigger.tacacsrc`, which
  provides functionality to cache and retrieve user credentials:

  - Added a new function `~trigger.tacacsrc.validate_credentials()` to (you
    guessed it!) validate credentials. It supports input in the form 2-tuples
    (username, password), 3-tuples (username, password, realm), and
    dictionaries of the same and returns a `~trigger.tacacsrc.Credentials`
    object.

+ The following changes have been made to Trigger's command-line utilities:

  - :feature:`60` ``bin/load_acl`` will now shutdown gracefully if initial
    the MySQL connection fails, using a try..except to display some
    information about the connection failure without a traceback. For other
    MySQL issues, we will leave as is (dumping the traceback) because they
    would represent coding or transient issues, and we should present as much
    information as we have.
  - :feature:`20` ``bin/gnng`` (get_nets) In support of displaying Juniper
    'sp' interfaces (which are un-numbered and were being skipped for this
    reason), we've added flags to include un-numbered (``-u``) or disabled
    (``-d``) interfaces for any device platform.

.. _v1.2.4:

1.2.4
=====

+ The commands required to commit/save the configuration on a device are now
  attached to `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevice` objects under the
  `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevice.commit_commands` attribute, to make it easier
  to execute these commands without having to determine them for yourself.
+ :feature:`56` Added a way to optionally perform a ``commit full`` operation
  on Juniper devices by defining a dictionary of attributes and values for
  matching devices using :setting:`JUNIPER_FULL_COMMIT_FIELDS`. This modifies
  the ``commit_commands`` that are assigned when the
  `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevice` object is created.
+ :bug:`33` Console paging is now disabled by default for async SSH channels.

.. _v1.2.3:

1.2.3
=====

+ :feature:`47` Added parsing of ranges for ``fragment-offset`` statements in
  Juniper ACLs.
+ :bug:`49` Changed ACL parser to omit src/dst ports if port range is
  ``0-65535``.
+ :bug:`50` Fix typo that was causing Cisco parsing to generate an unhandled
  exception within `~trigger.cmds.NetACLInfo`.
+ Minor bugfix when checking device names and printing a warning within
  `~trigger.cmds.Commando`.
+ Updated docs to say we're using a interactive Python interpreter and added
  OpenHatch profile to contact info.

.. _v1.2.2:

1.2.2
=====

- :feature:`16` Arista support was added to ``bin/load_acl``
- :bug:`45` Added "SSH-1.99" as a valid SSHv2 version in
  `~trigger.utils.network.test_ssh()` to fix a bug in which devices presenting
  this banner were errantly falling back to telnet and causing weird behavior
  during interactive sessions.
- :feature:`46` Changed `~trigger.twister.connect()` to pass the vendor name to
  `~trigger.gorc.get_init_commands()` so that it is more explicit when
  debugging.
- :feature:`29` Added an extensible event notification system

  - A new pluggable notification system has been added in
    `~trigger.utils.notifications`, which defaults to email notifications.
    New event handlers and event types can be easily added and specified
    with the configuration using :setting:`NOTIFICATION_HANDLERS`.

  - The following changes have been made to ``bin/load_acl``:

    - All alerts are now using the new notification system
    - ``email_users()`` moved to `~trigger.utils.notifications.send_email()`
    - All calls to send failures now call
      `~trigger.utils.notifications.send_notification()`
    - All calls to send successes now calls
      `~trigger.utils.notifications.send_email()`

  - In support of the new notification system, the following config
    settings have been added:

    - :setting:`EMAIL_SENDER` - The default email sender
    - :setting:`NOTIFICATION_SENDER` - The default notification sender
    - :setting:`SUCCESS_RECIPIENTS` - Hosts/addresses to send successes
    - :setting:`FAILURE_RECIPIENTS` - Hosts/addresses to send failures
    - :setting:`NOTIFICATION_HANDLERS` - A list of handler functions to
      process in order

  - A new utility module has been added to import modules in
    `~trigger.utils.importlib`, and ``trigger.conf.import_path()`` was moved to
    `~trigger.utils.importlib.import_module_from_path()` to bring these import
    tools under one roof.

.. _v1.2.1:

1.2.1
=====

- :bug:`30` Bugfix in ``bin/acl`` where tftproot was hard-coded. It now reads
  from :setting:`TFTPROOT_DIR`.
- :feature:`37` Fixed misleading "make discard" output from
  ``bin/check_access``, to use the ``Term.extra`` attribute to store a
  user-friendly comment to make it clear that the term's action has been
  modified by the "make discard" keyword.
- :feature:`39`  Call ``create_cm_ticket()`` in a ``try..commit`` block so it
  can't crash ``bin/load_acl``.
- :bug:`40` Update dot_gorc.example with ``[init_commands]``.
- :bug:`43` Bugfix in bin/acl to address incorrect exception reference from
  when exceptions were cleaned up in release 1.2.
- Simplified basic `~trigger.cmds.Commando` example in ``docs/index.rst``.
- Simplified activity output in `~trigger.cmds.Commando` base to/from methods
- Replaced all calls to ``time.sleep()`` with ``reactor.callLater()`` within
  `~trigger.twister` support of the ``command_interval`` argument to Twisted
  state machine constructors.
- Added a way to do SSH version detection within `~trigger.utils.network`

  - Enhanced `~trigger.utils.network.test_tcp_port()` to support optional
    ``check_result`` and ``expected_result`` arguments. If ``check_result`` is
    set, the first line of output is retreived from the connection and the
    starting characters must match ``expected_result``.
  - Added a `~trigger.utils.network.test_ssh()` function to shortcut to check
    port 22 for a banner. Defaults to SSHv2.
  - SSH auto-detection in `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevices` objects now uses
    `~trigger.utils.network.test_ssh()`.

- Added a new `~trigger.utils.crypt_md5()` password-hashing function.
- Added proper argument signature to `~trigger.acl.db.get_netdevices`.
- Updated misnamed ``BadPolicerNameError`` to `~trigger.exceptions.BadPolicerName`
- More and better documentation improvements, including new documentation for
  ``bin/acl_script``.

.. _v1.2:

1.2
===

- :feature:`23` Commando API overhauled and support added for RANCID

  - RANCID is now officially supported as a source for network device
    metadata. A new RANCID compatibility module has been added at
    `~trigger.rancid`, with support for either single or multiple instance
    configurations. Multiple instances support can be toggled by setting
    :setting:`RANCID_RECURSE_SUBDIRS` to ``True``.

  - The following changes have been made to `~trigger.netdevices`:

    - `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevices` can now import from RANCID
    - A new `~trigger.netdevices.Vendor` type has been added to
      `~trigger.netdevices` to store canonical vendor names as determined by
      the new setting :setting:`VENDOR_MAP`.
    - When `~trigger.netdevice.NetDevice` objects are created, the manufacturer
      attribute is mapped to a dynamic vendor attribute. This is intended to
      normalize the way that Trigger identifies vendors internally by a single
      lower-cased word.
    - All `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevice` objects now have a ``vendor``
      attribute with their canonical `~trigger.netdevices.Vendor` object
      attached to it.
    - If the ``deviceType`` attribute is not set, it is determined
      automatically based on the ``vendor`` attribute. The default types for
      each vendor can be customized using :setting:`DEFAULT_TYPES`. If a vendor
      is not specified witihin :setting:`DEFAULT_TYPES`,
      :setting:`FALLBACK_TYPE`. will be used.
    - All logical comparisons that onced used the hard-coded value of the
      ``manufacturer`` attribute of a device now instead compare against the
      ``vendor`` attribute.
    - You may now tell NetDevices not to fetch acls from AclsDB when
      instantiate you may also do the same for individual NetDevice objects
      that you manually create

  - The following changes have been made to `~trigger.cmds`:

    - The `~trigger.cmds.Commando` class been completely redesigned to reduce
      boilerplate and simplify creation of new command adapters. This is
      leveraging the changes to `~trigger.netdevice.NetDevice` objects, where
      the vendor name can be expected to always be normalized to a single,
      lower-cased word. Defining commands to send to devices is as simple as
      definiing a ``to_{vendor}`` method, and parsing return results as simple
      as ``from_{vendor}``.
    - All dynamic method lookups are using the normalized vendor name (e.g.
      cisco, juniper).
    - Base parse/generate lookup can be disabled explicitly in
      `~trigger.cmds.Commando` subclasses or as an argument to the constructor.
    - `~trigger.cmds.NetACLInfo` adapted to use Commando 2.0

  - The following changes have been made to Trigger's exception handling

    - All exceptions moved to `~trigger.exceptions` and given docstrings
    - ``trigger.acl.exceptions`` has been removed
    - All calls to exceptions updated to new-style exceptions

  - A new -v option has been added to ``bin/netdev`` to support vendor lookups

- :feature:`4` Support for SSH auto-detection and pty/async improvements:

  - The following changes have been made to `~trigger.twister`:

    - Detection of remotely closed SSH connections so ``bin/gong`` users can be
      properly notified (e.g. ssh_exchange_identification errors)
    - New `~trigger.twister.execute` function to automatically choose the best
      ``execute_`` function for a given `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevice` object,
      and is now attached to all `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevice` objects
    - `~trigger.twister.execute_ioslike` now determines whether to use SSH or
      Telnet automatically
    - All pty connection logic moved out of ``bin/gong`` into
      `~trigger.twister` and is exposed as the `~trigger.twister.connect`
      function and also attached to all `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevice` objects
    - Interactive sessions may now be optionally logged to a file-like object by
      passing the log_to argument to the `~trigger.twister.Interactor`
      constructor
    - `~trigger.twister.execute_junoscript` now using
      `~trigger.twister.execute_generic_ssh`
    - Command interval added to Junoscript channels for consistency
    - Global `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevices` import removed from twister;
      moved to only occur when a telnet channel is created

  - The following changes have been made to `~trigger.netdevices`:

    - All `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevice` objects now have a
      `~trigger.twister..execute` method to perform async interaction
    - The `~trigger.twister.connect` function is now automatically attached to
      every `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevice` object; to get a pty it's as simple
      as ``dev.connect()``.
    - New helper methods added to `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevice` objects:

      - SSH functionality methods: `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevice.has_ssh()`
        (port connection test), `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevice.can_ssh_async()`
        (device supports async), `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevice.can_ssh_pty()`
        (device supports pty)
      - `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevice.is_ioslike()` to test if a device is
        IOS-like as specified by :setting:`IOSLIKE_VENDORS`.
      - `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevice.is_netscreen` to test if a device is a
        NetScreen firewall
      - `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevice.is_reachable` to test if a device
        responds to a ping

  - The following changes have been made to `~trigger.conf.settings`:

    - A mapping of officially supported platforms has been defined at
      :setting:`SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS`
    - :setting:`VALID_VENDORS` has been renamed to :setting:`SUPPORTED_VENDORS`
    - A mapping of officially supported device types has been defined at
      :setting:`SUPPORTED_TYPES`
    - You may now disable telnet fallback by toggling :setting:`TELNET_ENABLED`
    - You may now disable SSH for pty or async by vendor/type using
      :setting:`SSH_PTY_DISABLED` and :setting:`SSH_ASYNC_DISABLED`
      respectively
    - :setting:`SSH_TYPES` has been removed as it is no longer needed

  - `~trigger.cmds.Commando` experimentally using the new
    ``NetDevice.execute()`` method
  - Two new helper functions added to `~trigger.utils.cli`:
    `~trigger.utils.cli.setup_tty_for_pty` and
    `~trigger.utils.cli.update_password_and_reconnect`, which modularize
    functionality that was in bin/gong that didn't seem to fit anywhere else

- :feature:`21` The following changes have been made to support A10 hardware
  and to enhance handling of SSH channels:

  - Added a new generic SSH channel. The NetScreen and A10 channels are based
    from this. Further abstraction needed to roll NetScaler channel into this
    as well.
  - Added a new `~trigger.twister.execute_generic_ssh` factory function.
  - Refactored `~trigger.twister.execute_netscreen` to use `~trigger.twister.execute_generic_ssh`
  - Added a new `~trigger.twister.execute_ioslike_ssh` factory function
    utilizing the generic SSH channel to support SSH on IOS-like devices
    (Brocade, Cisco, Arista, A10, etc.). Works like a charm except for the
    Brocade VDX.
  - The `~trigger.cmds.Commando` was updated to support A10, NetScreen. Brocade,
    Arista changed to use SSH vs. telnet.
  - All prompt-matching patterns moved to top of `trigger.twister` as constants
  - A10 added to :setting:`IOSLIKE_VENDORS`

- :feature:`24` ``bin/gong`` will now display the reason when it fails to
  connect to a device.

.. _v1.1:

1.1
===

- All changes from release 1.0.0.100 (oh hey, duh) are officially part of this
  release
- :bug:`9` Fixed missing imports from ``bin/acl_script`` and removed a bunch of
  duplicated code already within the Trigger libs.
- Added new keywords to setup.py
- Some new utilities added to `~trigger.acl.tools` for merging new access into
  an existing ACL object
- :feature:`17` `~trigger.acl.parser.RangeList` now sorts port range tuples
  when parsing access-lists.
- :bug:`8` `~trigger.tacacsrc.get_device_password` user-friendly message moved
  to `~trigger.twister.pty_connect` so it no longer bleeds into
  non-interactive usage.
- :bug:`15` `~trigger.acl.parser.Term.output_ios` updated to support optional
  ``acl_name`` argument for cases when you need to output a
  `~trigger.acl.parser.Term` separately from an `~trigger.acl.parser.ACL`
  object. `~trigger.acl.tools.check_access`, ``bin/check_access``, and
  ``bin/find_access`` also had to be updated to utilize this new argument.
- :bug:`19` `~trigger.acl.tools.check_access` updated to support 'complicated'
  checks against Juniper firewall terms with a 'port' statement defined.

1.0.0.100
=========

- `~trigger.conf` converted from a module to a package.
- All global default settings are now baked into trigger.conf.settings
- `~trigger.conf.settings` and `~trigger.acl.autoacl` may now be imported without the
  proper expected config files in place on disk. If the config files cannot be
  found, default versions of these objects will be returned.
- All trigger modules can now be imported with default values (but don't try
  instantiating any objects without following the install instructions!)
- :bug:`2` Fixed a bug in :class:`~trigger.tacacsrc.Tacacsrc` where newly-created
  .tacacsrc files were world-readable. Correct 0600 perms are now enforced on
  every write().
- :feature:`3` Added the ability for :class:~trigger.twister.IoslikeSendExpect`
  to handle confirmation prompts (such as when a device asks you "are you sure?
  [y/N]:" by detecting common cases within the prompt-matching logic.
- :feature:`5` Added ability for gong --oob to lookup devices by partial
  hostnames using :func:`~trigger.netdevices.device_match`.
- :bug:`6` The `get_firewall_db_conn()` function was moved out of `settings.py`
  and into `~trigger.acl.queue.Queue` where it belongs.
- :feature:`7` Updated :func:`~trigger.twister.has_ioslike_error` to support
  Brocade VDX errors.


1.0.0.90
========

- Added support for .gorc file to specify commands to run when using gong to
  login to a device. Unique commands cand be specified for each vendor.
- Default realm for credentials within .tacacsrc can now be specified within
  settings.DEFAULT_REALM
- The following changes have been made to trigger.tacacsrc:

  - New module-level update_credentials() function added to facilitate updating of
    cached user credentials by client applications (e.g. gong)

  - Tacacsrc._parse_old() completely redesigned with real error-handling for
    bad/missing passwords (GPG-parsing coming "Soon")
  - New Tacacsrc.update_creds() method used to facilitate update of stored
    credentials within .tacacsrc
  - Realm is now stored as an attribute on Credentials objects to simplify
    loose-coupling of device/realm information while passing around
    credentials.
  - prompt_credentials() refactored to be more user-friendly.
  - Blank passwords can no longer be stored within .tacacsrc.

- The following changes have been made to trigger.twister:

    list of initial_commands to execute on a device upon logging in.
  - TriggerClientFactory now reads the default realm from
    settings.DEFAULT_REALM when populating credentials.
  - TriggerClientFactory credentials detection improved
  - All referencing of username/password from credentials by index replaced
    with attributes.

  password.

1.0.0.80
========

- Typo fix in sample conf/trigger_settings.py
- Explicit imports from trigger.acl and a little docstring cleanup in bin/optimizer
- trigger.acl.autoacl.autoacl() now takes optional explicit_acls as 2nd
  argument, a set of ACL names, so that we can reference explicit_acls within
  autoacl() implicit ACL logic, but we don't have to rely on the internals.
- trigger.acl.db.AclsDB.get_acl_set() modified to populate explicit_acls before
  implicit_acls. autoacl() is now called with these explicit_acls as the 2nd
  argument.
