    """
    Execute commands asynchronously on multiple network devices.

    This class is designed to be extended but can still be used as-is to execute
    commands and return the results as-is.

    At the bare minimum you must specify a list of ``devices`` to interact with.
    You may optionally specify a list of ``commands`` to execute on those
    devices, but doing so will execute the same commands on every device
    regardless of platform.

    If ``commands`` are not specified, they will be expected to be emitted by
    the ``generate`` method for a given platform. Otherwise no commands will be
    executed.

    If you wish to customize the commands executed by device, you must define a
    ``to_{vendor_name}`` method containing your custom logic.

    If you wish to customize what is done with command results returned from a
    device, you must define a ``from_{vendor_name}`` method containing your
    custom logic.

    :param devices:
        A list of device hostnames or `~trigger.netdevices.NetDevice` objects

    :param commands:
        (Optional) A list of commands to execute on the ``devices``.

    :param creds:
        (Optional) A 3-tuple of (username, password, realm). If only (username,
        password) are provided, realm will be populated from
        :setting:`DEFAULT_REALM`. If unset it will fetch from ``.tacacsrc``.

    :param incremental:
        (Optional) A callback that will be called with an empty sequence upon
        connection and then called every time a result comes back from the
        device, with the list of all results.

    :param max_conns:
        (Optional) The maximum number of simultaneous connections to keep open.

    :param verbose:
        (Optional) Whether or not to display informational messages to the
        console.

    :param timeout:
        (Optional) Time in seconds to wait for each command executed to return a
        result. Set to ``None`` to disable timeout (not recommended).

    :param production_only:
        (Optional) If set, includes all devices instead of excluding any devices
        where ``adminStatus`` is not set to ``PRODUCTION``.

    :param allow_fallback:
        If set (default), allow fallback to base parse/generate methods when
        they are not customized in a subclass, otherwise an exception is raised
        when a method is called that has not been explicitly defined.

    :param with_errors:
        (Optional) Return exceptions as results instead of raising them. The
        default is to always return them.

    :param force_cli:
        (Optional) Juniper only. If set, sends commands using CLI instead of
        Junoscript.

    :param with_acls:
         Whether to load ACL associations (requires Redis). Defaults to whatever
         is specified in settings.WITH_ACLS

    :param command_interval:
         (Optional) Amount of time in seconds to wait between sending commands.

    :param stop_reactor:
         Whether to stop the reactor loop when all results have returned.
